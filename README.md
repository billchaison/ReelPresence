Polycom RealPresence Desktop Password Decryption

![alt text](https://github.com/billchaison/ReelPresence/blob/master/rp00.png)

The Polycom RealPresence Desktop software for Windows allows the user to save Enterprise credentials enabling automatic logon.  Once the user's password file is obtained, this technique can be used to decrypt it.

The ReelPresence exploit resides under a protected repository in my BitBucket
